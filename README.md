# 2 Separate Scoreboards.

## 1) Main Scoreboard: Keeps track of points acquired across all games
Running '/main' will show the total points you have across all games thus far.

Unfortunately after each minigame, admins will have to run '/main' in order to redisplay the main scoreboard but now with the added points from the game that had just finished, since Game Scoreboard and Main Scoreboard are 2 different plugins.





## 2) Game Scoreboard: Keeps track of points acquired across a single game
After an admin uses '/gamestart', a scoreboard will be set up for every single player on the server and a timer for the game will begin simultaneously. 

Every player's points are different from one another and will increment throughtout the game and this change is also consanttly being reflected on the leaderboard

After the timer for the game hits 0, top 5 players for the game will be displayed in chat. Game points are added to main scoreboard points and are reset to 0 automatically.

Unfortunately after each minigame, admins will have to run '/main' in order to redisplay the main scoreboard but now with the added points from the game that had just finished, since Game Scoreboard and Main Scoreboard are 2 different plugins.





## 3) In order for game leaderboard to accurately track points, another plugin from https://github.com/Suiron99/Points-Survival-Damage-Kill- has to be downloaded.
